While more data can provide a informative and more clarity for the model to learn. while using the entire training dataset can provide the model with more information and potentially improve its accuracy, it's essential to balance this with considerations of data quality, model complexity, and the risk of overfitting. Techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and careful dataset preparation can help determine the optimal amount of training data to use for the best test performance.\n",

        "The decrease in accuracy from the first run to the second, despite using more training data, can be attributed to several factors, including the learning rate and the characteristics of the additional data. In the above generated results,the learning rate in the first run is ten times higher than in the second run. A higher learning rate can sometimes allow the model to learn faster, though it also risks overshooting the minimum of the loss function.\n",
